	- Are these frequencies obtained from uppercase-only text? Or are they treated as if there is no differention between upper and lowercase in regular text with spaces, commas, periods, exclamation marks etc?
	- Either way they seem to work very well for several [A-Z] cleartexts I have tested them on
